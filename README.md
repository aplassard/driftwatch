# driftwatch
DriftWatch runs a 100-item rotating eval plus a per-minute sentinel across multiple LLMs to detect drift in accuracy, latency, and behaviorâ€”live

## GSM8K Sentinel CLI

Install dependencies and expose the CLI:

```bash
uv sync --dev
```

Run a specific GSM8K test problem against one or more models. The results are
written as a JSONL file in the provided output directory. The file name is the
timestamp at the start of the run.

```bash
uv run python -m driftwatch.cli --index 5 --models openai/gpt-5-nano other/model --output-dir results/
```

Each line contains the prompt, raw OpenAI response object, token usage, latency,
and whether the model produced the correct final answer.

### Cron job

To execute one problem every minute using the current minute as the question
index:

```
* * * * * cd /path/to/driftwatch && \
    uv run python -m driftwatch.cli --index $(date +\%M) \
    --models openai/gpt-5-nano another/model \
    --output-dir /path/to/output >> /path/to/cron.log 2>&1
```

At 11:29 this will evaluate problem 29 from the GSM8K test set. Adjust the
model list and output location as needed.
